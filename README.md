# pyo-nk2

Just a quick abstraction layer to use a nanoKONTROL2 from a python/pyo script (http://ajaxsoundstudio.com/software/pyo/).

Allows to access faders, knobs and buttons by name instead of figuring out the MIDI CC number.
Also, allows to put the device's leds in so-called "external" mode and control them programmatically -
without using Korg's proprietary software.

The `__main__` part of `__init__.py` shows how to use it. There's no other doc for now. Just read the code!

Enjoy!
